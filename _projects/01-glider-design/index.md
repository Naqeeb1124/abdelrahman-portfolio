# Glider Design Project

## Institution
Zewail City of Science and Technology  
Course: SPC201 - Introduction to Air and Space Flights

## Abstract
Design unpowered glider relying on glide characteristics. Used 3mm/4mm balsawood sheets, 6mm rod, clay for nose weight. Wing AR ~8 (later 16). Stabilizer at back. Airfoil-shaped wing for lift.

## Introduction
Shaped wing as airfoil despite flat plate recommendation. Initial 3mm thin, unstable; increased to 4mm for stability. AR 16 reduced induced drag (Di = L * CL / (π AR)).

Desirable traits: High L/D, suitable CL/CD, alpha=5°, camber, t/c, low Re, CM.

## Methodology
Used CFD software for calculations:
- CM_y vs alpha
- CL vs alpha
- CD_0 vs alpha
Mass ~22.56g. Angle of attack 5°.

Dimensions: Wing 40cm x 4.5cm x 4mm, stabilizer/fuselage per blueprint.

Dihedral wing for roll stability.

## Results and Discussion
Built model: Sanded airfoil wing, assembled fuselage, tail, wing. Flight: 20m test, 34m open.

## Conclusions
Applied aerodynamics to balance stability/performance. Demonstrated CFD use in design.
