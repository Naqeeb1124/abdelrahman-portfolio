# Aquaponics System Design

## Institution
Zewail City of Science and Technology  
Course: ENGR207 - Fluid Mechanics

## Abstract
Sustainable system combining fish farming and plant cultivation in a closed loop, with fish waste nourishing plants and plants filtering water.

## Introduction
Aquaponics combines aquaculture and hydroponics. Fish waste provides nutrients for plants; plants clean water for fish. Components: fish tank, grow beds, circulation system.

## Methodology
Analyzed bell siphon, venturi meter, venturi aerator with equations for flow rates, Reynolds numbers, dimensions.

## Results
Fish tank: 1mÂ³, 1000L. Grow bed: Rectangular, gravel-filled. Circulation: 300L/h with pump, pipes, valves. Achieves nutrient distribution and oxygenation.

## Conclusions
Affordable ($1900), sustainable food production with year-round yield, reduced environmental impact, efficient water use.
