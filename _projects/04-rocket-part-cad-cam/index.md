# Rocket Part CAD + CAM

## Institution
Zewail City of Science and Technology  
Course: REE 222 - Engineering Production

## P-1003 Rocket Assembly
- **Initial Dimensions**: Length 0.8 in, Diameter 1 in
- **Processes**: External Turning, Drilling, Boring, Grooving, Parting Off

## P-1004 Rocket Assembly
- **Initial Dimensions**: Length 1.2 in, Diameter 1 in
- **Processes**: External Turning, Grooving, Drilling, Internal Threading, Internal Taper Turning, Parting

## Calculations
- Machine time increases due to setup and moving time between processes.

## Results
- **P-1003**: Actual time 2m 24s, Theoretical time 1m 1s (video sped up, setup time ignored, feed rate 0.0046875 in/rev vs 0.004 in/rev)
- **P-1004**: Actual time 42s, Theoretical time 1m 2s (video sped up, setup time ignored, feed rate 0.019 in/rev vs 0.0028 in/rev)

## Visuals
- CAD and CAM photos included for design and machining verification.
